# PyCar

This is a try. 
I want to learn Python and I have an Arduino Yun so I will try to make a car powered by arduino Yun and a Raspberry. The purpose of the pi is to attach a webcam to the car in order i can control it throught Internet. So i will try to implement pattern recognition and computer vision throught python.
